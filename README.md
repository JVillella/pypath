## PyPath
###### Python Path Tracer

PyPath is a concise path tracer written in python. It is focused on readability, extensibility and learning for new comers. At around 500 lines of code it supports:
- Path tracing
- Materials
 - Lambertian/Diffuse
 - Perfect Specular Reflection
 - Glossy Specular
- Simple Primitives
 - Spheres
 - Planes
- Stochastic sampling to help eliminate anti-aliasing
- Image output to .ppm file
- Non-stationary camera
- Concise and easy to read OOP code

It is very easy to create scenes and extend the barebone application. I hope PyPath will help others get their feet wet in the awesome path-tracing technique!
